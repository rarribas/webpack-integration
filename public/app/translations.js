You can read more in-depth details on this in our article here: Getting set up for review.</div>\n<div><strong>Adding reviewers and ensuring they are ready to review</strong></div>\n<div>Next, you can start adding your reviewers. All you need is the names and email addresses to enter them to the system. Then, before you start the review, they will need to be assigned topics, otherwise they will not be given anything to review. Check out our article on this here: Adding reviewers.</div>\n<div><strong>Allocating submissions to reviewers</strong></div>\n<div>When you are ready to start the review and have completed the above steps, you will allocate submissions to reviewers.
